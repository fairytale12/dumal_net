              <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
              <p><span class="drop-caps drop-caps-square">H</span>e is here. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Ye-ha! I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
              <h1>Heading 1</h1>
              <p>Ye-ha! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I call it luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
              <h2>Heading 2</h2>
              <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Red Five standing by. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>

              <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.</p>
              <h4>Heading 4</h4>
              <p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. No! Alderaan is peaceful. </p>
              <h5>Heading 5</h5>
              <p>We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
              <h6>Heading 6</h6>
              <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. He is here. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. </p>

              <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Don't underestimate the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- What!? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

              <p>I'm trying not to, kid. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
